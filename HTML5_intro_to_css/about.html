            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p> If you haven’t noticed by now, we are an extremely different Property Management Company. In fact, we specifically set out to disrupt the status quo of Real Estate Property Management – to develop a communication focused, investor-centric asset management firm.
                 
                Founded on a Mission to create an environment of confidence, transparency, and value – Quality is our culture and the promise we make to you. A pledge made possible only by the extremely talented and exceptional individuals of the Build Ventures team who share a deep passion and commitment for outstanding workmanship, communication, and service.
                
                Our proven platform of fully integrated automation teams, comprehensive fiscal management, and exclusive vendor-subcontractor relationships affords and guarantees the highest level of service, while certifying legal compliance, ensuring safety and upkeep, and delivering the absolute best in B2B management, eliminating the hassles of property ownership.
                    
                We highly value the opportunity to work with forward-thinking clients and believe our like-minded partnerships have been the foundation of the success we have built. For this, we are truly grateful for your trust, and would be honored to incorporate your investment property into our prized portfolio.</p>
